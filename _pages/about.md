About Me
====
I am a 2nd-year Ph.D. student at [ARISE Lab](http://ariselab.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/), [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Michael R. Lyu](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/lyu/). I received my B.Sc. and M.Eng. degrees in Computer Science from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/) in 2019 and 2022 respectively, supervised by [Prof. Yangfan Zhou](https://appsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~yfzhou/).

My research focuses on **Software Engineering**. Currently, I am interested in WebAssembly runtime systems.
