# About Me

I am a 3rd-year Ph.D. student at [ARISE Lab](http://ariselab.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/), [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Michael R. Lyu](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/lyu/). I received my B.Sc. and M.Eng. degrees in Computer Science from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/) in 2019 and 2022 respectively, supervised by [Prof. Yangfan Zhou](https://appsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~yfzhou/).

My research focuses on **software testing, debugging, and optimization**. Currently, I am interested in performance testing and optimization for WebAssembly runtime systems.
